1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   Project3 was a difficult one to understand, but when it comes to coding it was not as hard as I thought. 
   It mainly focused on for loops and lists, and when accessing the data file, it was different because in many cases it would just be a code line, but it was in the terminal.
   

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   N/A                  N/A        N/A

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   It was a fun learning experience, but it really helped me figured out, that if problem not read correctly.
   It can lead me to a more confusing route.
